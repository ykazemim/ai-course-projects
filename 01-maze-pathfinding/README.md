# AI Maze Pathfinding Algorithms

This project is part of an **Artificial Intelligence (AI) course** focused on **pathfinding algorithms**. The goal is to implement **search algorithms** to find an optimal path in a **randomly generated maze**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project includes:
- A **maze generator** (using **Primâ€™s Algorithm**).
- A **graph representation** of the maze.
- Several **pathfinding algorithms** that students must implement:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**
  - **A*** (A-Star)
  - **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
