# AUT-AI-Core-Projects

This repository archives the projects that I have done for the **Artificial Intelligence** course at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**.

This collection demonstrates a practical understanding of fundamental AI concepts, including search algorithms, game theory, constraint satisfaction, meta-heuristics, and classic machine learning pipelines, all implemented in **Python**.
